# Serhat's dotfiles and scripts

__On Progress:__

Till then you can look at : [system-bak](https://github.com/SerhatTeker/system-bak)

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork
this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need.
Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own
risk!
